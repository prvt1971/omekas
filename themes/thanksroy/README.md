# Thanks, Roy
A tribute to Roy Rosenzweig. A serif theme for Omeka S based off [the theme for Omeka Classic](https://github.com/omeka/theme-thanksroy).


## Customizing the Theme

For those dipping their toes into customizing sites with CSS, the [CSS Editor](https://omeka.org/s/modules/CSSEditor/) module allows site administrators to write style overrides.

For advanced CSS and Sass users, Thanks, Roy provides variables for easily customizing typography, spacing, and colors in `asset/sass/_base.scss`.

### Sass Tasks

Run these commands within the theme's root directory.

* **npm start**: While this task runs, it watches for changes to sass files and recompiles the CSS.
* **gulp css**: This is the one-off task for compiling the current Sass/CSS.
  * **gulp css:watch**: This task watches for changes in the Sass, then compiles the CSS.
